# Latex-typed pdfs about arbitrary mathematics
(These have nothing to do with programming. I don't know why I put these here)

An attempt to collect and summarize, in a presentable way, pieces of math from my old rough notes

There are three items, with no current plans of adding any more in the future. One discusses the process of partial fraction decomposition and its relation to certain infinite series. Another discusses a theorem of geometry which provides a solution to a stubborn request no one would ever make. Third is a loose collection of problems, some from my independent discovery and some from the internet, that aren't too special to get their own pdf but special enough to save.
